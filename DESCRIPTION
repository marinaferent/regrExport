Description: Functions that ease the reporting stage of research projects that use lm, plm, coeftest, or glmer models.
    Coefficient, significance stars, and (bootstrapped) sandard error (t-statistic, or p-value) are reported according to social sciences standards.
    Provides a table of diagnostic tests for panel linear models - F-test, Hausman test, B-P/LM test of independence, Pasaran CD test of independence, Breusch-Godfrey/Wooldridge test for serial correlation in panel models, and Breusch-Pagan test for heteroskedasticity.
    The table comprises null hypothesis, statistic value, and also the decision of the test.
    Provides a comprehensive table of goodness of fit measures for glmer mixed effects logit models, such as random intercept, ICC, AIC, BIC, logLik, deviance, PCV, and R^2GLMM.
